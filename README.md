●	Create a report in Microsoft Word, and answer the following questions:
o	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
1.	Play has the most 340 incidences across the entire data set, hence the Crowd funding tactic tends to be more popular among theatre industry (plays).
2.	Word Music and Audio has the highest success rate 100%; if we define the success rate by (success fund/total incidences); we are aware of the limited number of occurrences though.
3.	Mobile games have the lowest successful rate.  avoid using crowdfunding tactic; (Science Fiction & Food truck may also not suitable)

o	What are some limitations of this dataset?
1.	Word Music and Audio has the highest successful rate 100%; if we define the success rate by (success fund/total incidences); we do aware the limited of incidence (Total 3 occurrences-Music;). we may question the validity due to limit number of kickstarts
2.	We do not know whether or not the category of each individual industry will impact the success rate of funding or not. For example, Will mobile gaming projects rarely get funded regardless of the funding method?
3.	The time series does not include recent years. The insight may not apply to today’s market.
4.	For theater/play, which has the most incidences, the success rate has a tendency toward neutral rating at only 54%. Will crowdfunding itself really impact the successful rate? Or the successful rate like a coin flip- tends to become 50%-once the sample size becomes larger enough.

o	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
1.	Add a slicer on the pivot table. Make filter data easier and capture nuance changes.
2.	Add dot plot based on category & subcategory. Understand the distribution base on each category among success vs unsuccess
3.	Have a frequency table based on bonus assignment1 intervals. To better study the distribution.
4.	A correlation table to show the relationship among pledged amount and backer counts for a specific subcategory. To test the given wisdom among the number of backers vs. total amount pledged.
